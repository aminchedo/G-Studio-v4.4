# Optional Dependencies for Full Functionality

# Core Analysis (Highly Recommended)
networkx>=2.6        # Dependency graph and cycle detection
numpy>=1.20.0        # Numerical operations for feature vectors

# Advanced Features
scikit-learn>=0.24.0 # Clone detection with TF-IDF and cosine similarity
tree-sitter>=0.20.0  # Accurate AST parsing

# Language-Specific Parsers
tree-sitter-typescript>=0.20.0
tree-sitter-javascript>=0.20.0
tree-sitter-python>=0.20.0

# UI/UX Enhancements
tqdm>=4.60.0         # Progress bars
colorama>=0.4.4      # Cross-platform colored terminal output

# Note: The tool works without these dependencies with reduced functionality
# Install all: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install minimal: pip install networkx numpy (for core features)
# Install none: Still works with regex parsing and basic analysis
