CAPABILITY REPORT: main-fixer-9.py v3.0.0
==========================================
Features: Project scanning, dependency graph building, duplicate detection (exact+structural), usage analysis (unused/unwired), circular dependency detection, import conflict detection, type inconsistency analysis, stability scoring, archive creation (safe copies only), HTML dashboard generation, JSON/CSV reports
Limitations: No --dry-run flag, no machine-readable-only output mode, large monolithic file (3896 lines), limited test coverage, no incremental analysis mode
Risks: LOW - Read-only analysis by default, archive creation requires explicit confirmation, no file deletion/modification without user approval, no network calls, no shell execution
Python: 3.x (stdlib only, no external deps)
File I/O: Read-only scanning, writes only to reports/ folder, archive creation copies files only
