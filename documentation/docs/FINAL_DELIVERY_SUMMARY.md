### How It Works

1. **You Talk:** "I want to create a weather app"
   
2. **AI Thinks:**
   ```
   💭 Understanding your request...
   💭 Planning the structure...
   💭 Choosing weather API...
   💭 Designing the UI...
   💭 Writing the code...
   ```

3. **AI Speaks:** "Done! I've created a weather app. Take a look!"

4. **Live Preview:** Shows working weather app

5. **You Refine:** "Make it colorful" or "Add 7-day forecast"

6. **AI Updates:** Changes appear instantly

**NO CODING REQUIRED FROM YOU!**
